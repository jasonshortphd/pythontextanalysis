# Python Text Analysis
Text sentiment analysis with python.  This is a non production project for learning.

I got it working on a dataset that I found online. 
I added stemming vs lemmatizing as options in the training of the models.  
But I don't know if that really matters (2% in my test).  Maybe I need to look at more model types other than Multinomial and LogisticRegression.

Where possible I will include links to any datasets that I found.

First data that I found:

Has lots of classified tweets.
0 = Negative
2 = Neutral
4 = Postive
